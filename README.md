Beyondar
========

This framework has been designed to offer some resources to those developers with an interest in working with Augmented Reality based on geolocalization on SmartPhones and tablets.

Don't forget to check the [wiki](https://github.com/BeyondAR/beyondar/wiki) and the [documentation](http://beyondar.github.io/beyondar/doxygen/index.html) to get more information about how to use this framework.

BeyondAR platform only supports Android (Google Glass included). We are currently working to support other platforms.
